## My process

Hello, this is my 1'st project here in The Odin Project. It's a simple landing page. 

### Built with

- Basic HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS
- FlexBox

### What I learned

Although it wasn't new to me. I've completed this kind of project previously from Frontend Mentors and other source. But I believe I've learned something new today.
`box-shadow:inset 0 0 0 2000px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.774);` 
this css was new that I haven't used ever in my code for showing color overlay for background image. I've used Linear Gradient instead.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs.
